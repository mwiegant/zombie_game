# About This Project

This is a small project that is slated to be completed over approx 2 weeks.  It is meant to be a sample of what I know, 
and reinforce my javascript skills.  It is also a place to begin building up my base of code.

### Structure of this Project

This project is setup to run as so:

    index.html
        |
        |-> index.js
                |
                |-> main.js
                       |
                       |-> [all code within js folder]

All in-game objects are children of the Sprite object (sprite.js).  All properties or behaviours that are common in most
of a Sprite's children are included in the Sprite object.


### ~ Other Notes

I'm thinking about writing a generalized functionality file to do simple, but common tasks like removing objects from 
arrays.  There are certainly some processes that I'd like to turn into functions, which would have their own file.  As it
stands, I am beginning to build a library of code just from the require.js and input.js files, which I will be 
continuing to use in the future.

Files to include in code library:
    --> require.js
    --> input.js
    --> widget.js
    --> fpscounter.js

Other Specs, Important Dates, or information about using this code may be written in the future.
